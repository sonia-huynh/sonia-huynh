# Hello! 

## About Me
I'm Sonia, I enjoy creating projects that add entertainment or improve our day-to-day lives. Outside of coding, I like to read, crochet and play card/board games with my friends and family.

## Personal Project - BookBound
Since I love reading and reviewing books, I am currently building a personal book review and rating app called BookBound made using React, Typescript, Tailwind, SQLite (with knex), Node.js, Superagent, Express, and GoogleBooks api.

## Current Learnings 
I'm currently taking Harvard CS50's Understanding Technology course to build up my foundational understanding of technology through learning about the software and hardware basics of computers and how everything is linked together. I am then going to move onto the Harvard CS50x course to learn more about problem solving both with and without code and also the languages of C, Python and SQL.
